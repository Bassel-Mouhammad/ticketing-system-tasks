# ticketing-system-tasks
A ticketing system is a tool used to manage and track requests, issues, or tasks that require attention. It helps businesses organise, prioritise, and resolve requests or incidents. The system typically allows users to submit tickets for issues or requests, which are then handled by support staff or administrators in a structured workflow.
